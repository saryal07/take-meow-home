# web-dev-final-project
The repository to store our code for the final project

**Requirement for this project**
- [ ] A nice-looking homepage to market your various products
- [ ] An about page to tell customers a little about your company as well as the reasons why customers should buy from you instead of your main competitor
- [ ] Be able to take online orders for products through an online form (orders will need to be stored in a database)
- [ ] A web interface to be able to view all orders that still need to be fulfilled (this will require a method for marking an order as fulfilled) as well as fulfilled orders that have not been paid for (and mark them as paid).

- [ ] You are to implement the pages in ASP.NET Core.  You may choose whatever language you want on the back end, but I recommend C#.
- [ ] You should format the Layout file nicely so it can be used by all of your pages.  At the very least, it should include a footer along with any other header and menu information that wonâ€™t change from page to page
- [ ] You will need to set up a database to store the orders and keep track of which orders have been fulfilled and which orders still need to pay.

- [ ] Design how we want the page to look like
- [ ] Make a database
- [ ] Write a brief introduction of the company
